# ValentinesYesOrNo

A fun and interactive Valentine's Day app designed as a gift for my girlfriend. Inspired by TikTok, this app adds a playful twist to the classical "Will you be my Valentine?" question.

## Features
- **Yes or No Buttons**:
  - Clicking "Yes" leads to a confirmation.
  - Clicking "No" makes the "Yes" button larger and displays random messages like:
    - "Are you sure? You're breaking my heart!"
    - "Don't do this to me!"
    - ...and 20+ more.
- **Dynamic Behaviour**: Buttons change in size and position based on user input.
- **Customizable Messages**: Add or modify the random messages to suit your needs.

## ToDo
- Add animations to make the interactions more playful.
- Implement a counter to track how many times "No" was clicked.
- Implement Responsive Design for mobile browsers.
